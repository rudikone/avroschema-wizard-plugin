## License üìÑ

## Use cases

The plugin simplifies kafka consumer testing when using avro schemas, and also provides additional features such as compatibility check.
It can be used in local testing, as well as in integration tests or CI.

Features:
- registration of schemes under subjects (topic-name)
- compatibility check

## How to use üë£

build.gradle.kts:
```
plugins {
    id("ru.rudikov.avroschema-wizard-plugin") version <version>
}

avroWizardConfig {
    schemaRegistryUrl = "some_url"
    searchAvroFilesPaths = setOf("../some/search/path/1", "../some/search/path/2")
    subjectToSchema = mapOf("some-topic-1" to "SomeSchemaName1", "some-topic-2" to "SomeSchemaName2")
}
```

run
```
gradle registerAllSchemas
```

The task will search for files with extension .avsc, whose names (without extension) are passed as __subjectToSchema__
map values, in the directories passed to __searchAvroFilesPaths__, and register schemas by the corresponding subjects
passed as __subjectToSchema__ map keys.
